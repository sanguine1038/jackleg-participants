# Jackleg Participants README
Created in Ren'Py. Last updated 5/1/2022

### -Credits and stuff-
sanguine1038 (me) did all the writing, most art, coding and suffering
birdiepooo did some sprite edits of certain characters

SHOUTOUT TO NANKIDAI YOURE COOL!!!
SHOUTOUT TO THE YTTD WIKI!!

This was made out of my love for Your Turn to Die.

### -Building the game-
Just download Ren'Py and just go off through there.

## -What you're allowed to do-
###  1. Take code for other Ren'Py projects.
 This includes the discussion tab code, only reason you're allowed to do that is because someone on reddit said they had the code for it and never shared it so to spite that person I'm leaving it here. SUCK IT u/DapperNachos EAT MY GIANT ENBY BALLS

### 2. Take the code for other YTTD projects.
  Gotta make sure that it gets everywhere to cuck DapperNachos.
 
### 3. Suggest better ways to format/code the game.
  I'm not one to say my code is super awesome and cool so if there are better ways to do it, please tell me.

## -What you're NOT allowed to do-
### 1. Taking credit from someone else.
  Say you've worked on this even though you have had 0 contact with the original developers. YALL AINT SLICK I SEE YOU. It does nothing but confuse people and you don't look any cooler for stealing someones work.
 
### 2. Repost the game on another website.
  The game files will forever ONLY be here, the website below and the YTTD Fan Wiki. If you guys see it anywhere else, it is likley either someone taking credit for it, or it's a virus.

### Additional Notes
* WORK ON YOUR OWN FAN STUFF! TODAYS MODDERS ARE TOMMOROWS DEVELOPERS!!!! Also this was all made by sanguine1038 (me) and I have no idea what I'm doing with GitHub so
if anything is out of place here just be paitent.
* If you wanna know more stuff about the Jackleg Participants go here: https://sanguine-archives.neocities.org/jackleg/jp-home.html (Not this is a sister site to a different project I also have no idea what I'm doing in.)
* READ THE WIKI!! NOW!
* Trans rights!
* If you're reading this and it says Ren'Py, you're looking at the wrong github page BOZO

Love yourself.
